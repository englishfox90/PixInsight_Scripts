## 🌟 AstroBin Export Tools

Located in `AstroBin Export/` directory.

### Main Script: `AstroBin_CSV_Export_v3_Modular.js`

**Purpose:** Generates CSV files compatible with AstroBin's bulk acquisition upload feature.

#### ✅ Key Features:
- **Automatic FITS Header Analysis**: Extracts exposure data, filters, telescope info, and more
 - **Comprehensive Filter Database**: 200+ filters across 22 manufacturers including:
   - Antlia (incl. EDGE & Ultra 2.5nm series), Askar ColorMagic, Astrodon, Astronomik, Baader (CMOS), Chroma, Optolong (L-eNhance / L-eXtreme), IDAS (NB, LPS), Altair, ZWO, SVBony, Vaonis/Vespera, Omega, TS-Optics, and more
   - Dual / tri / quad band coverage (ALP-T, Triband, Duo, Quad, NBZ, etc.)
 - **Personal LRGB + SHO Filter Set**: Define and persist your own preferred filter IDs for L, R, G, B, Ha, OIII, SII; auto‑applied when brand preference is set to `Auto`.
 - **Filter Name Column (UI)**: Displays resolved `Brand + Display Name` alongside raw FITS filter and editable Filter ID for clarity.
 - **Filter ID Auto‑Suggestion with Precedence**: Personal set → Preferred Brand match → Keyword fallback.
 - **Selectable / Persistent CSV Columns**: Choose which data columns to populate (headers always present for AstroBin compatibility). Choices persist between sessions.
 - **Improved SQM Derivation**: Correct luminosity conversion using `SQM = 14.18 − 2.5*log10(lux)` with clamping (15.0–22.2). Priority: direct SQM FITS header → LUX conversion → Bortle estimate → blank.
 - **Raw Frame Filtering**: Automatically excludes masters, calibrated, and integration outputs—only counts true LIGHT subframes.
 - **Manual Filter ID Entry**: For filters not in database - paste AstroBin URLs or enter IDs directly.
 - **Bortle Scale Integration**: Dropdown with descriptive ranges for accurate sky quality selection.
 - **Integration Summary**: Detailed per‑session statistics and environmental aggregation.

#### 🔧 Setup Requirements:
1. **Calibrated Images**: Works best with WBPP-calibrated or similar processed files
2. **FITS Headers**: Requires proper FITS metadata for automatic detection

#### 📊 Generated CSV Format:
Compatible with AstroBin's bulk upload expecting columns:
- `subject`, `description`, `data_source`, `locations`, `acquisition_type`
- `advanced_settings`, `deep_sky_acquisitions`, `solar_system_acquisitions`

#### 🎯 Workflow:
1. Load script in PixInsight
2. Select directory containing processed FITS files
3. (Optional) Click **Map Filters** to:
  - Review auto‑mapped filters
  - Enter missing IDs or paste AstroBin filter URLs
  - Define / Save your **Personal Filter Set** (LRGB + Ha/OIII/SII)
4. Set Bortle scale & environmental parameters (SQM auto‑fills from FITS / LUX / Bortle where possible)
5. (Optional) Use **Columns...** to toggle which CSV columns get populated
6. Generate CSV and upload to AstroBin

#### ⚠️ Important Notes:
- **Manual Filter Entry**: If your filter isn't in the database, select "Manual Entry" and paste the AstroBin filter URL (e.g., `https://app.astrobin.com/equipment/explorer/filter/4359/`) or enter the ID directly
- **Bortle Scale**: Choose the most accurate sky quality rating for your location
- **File Organization**: Keep processed files in organized directories for best results
- **Backup**: Always backup your original FITS files before processing
 - **Raw Frame Logic**: Only true LIGHT subframes are tallied—files whose paths or `IMAGETYP` suggest masters, calibrations, or integrations are ignored to prevent double counting.
 - **Filter Name vs Filter**: `Filter` shows the literal FITS header; `Filter Name` is the resolved database display string for readability.

### 🧪 Personal Filter Set (LRGB + SHO)

Use this when you mix brands (e.g., Baader LRGB + Antlia 3nm SHO) but want consistent auto‑mapping.

1. Run an analysis and open **Map Filters**.
2. In the Personal Filter Set section enter the AstroBin IDs (or pick from already mapped rows).
3. Click **Save Personal Set** (persists via PixInsight Settings).
4. Ensure **Filter Brand** is set to `Auto` (top of main dialog) so precedence is:
  - Personal set match (substring heuristics: `lum|lumin|l`, `red`, `green`, `blue`, `ha|h-alpha|halpha`, `oiii|o3|oxygen`, `sii|s2|sulfur|sulphur`)
  - Preferred brand keyword match (if brand not Auto)
  - First keyword fallback in database
5. Re‑run or refresh (**Analyze Images**) to see mappings applied.

You can click **Apply Personal Set** inside the mapping dialog to force remap without a full re‑analysis.

### 🗂️ Selectable CSV Column Population

Use **Columns...** to toggle which fields are populated. Headers always remain so AstroBin bulk import format is stable. `number` and `duration` are enforced populated (required by AstroBin).

Stored per user via PixInsight Settings (UInt32 flags) so your choices persist between sessions.

---

### 🌌 SQM & Environmental Logic

Priority for SQM:
1. Direct FITS SQM header
2. FITS LUX header converted with `SQM = 14.18 − 2.5 * log10(lux)` (clamped 15.0–22.2)
3. Bortle selection estimated midpoint
4. Left blank

FWHM & ambient temperature lock (disabled in UI) if reliably extracted from FITS session metadata.

---

### 🧹 Raw Frame Filtering Rules

Excluded automatically (case‑insensitive path or type checks):
`master`, `calibrated`, `integration`, `fastIntegration` and any `IMAGETYP` containing `master` or `integrat`. This prevents counting the same exposure metadata multiple times.

---

### 🆕 Recent Enhancements (2025‑09‑23)
| Feature | Summary |
|---------|---------|
| Filter Name column | Adds readable brand + display name next to raw FITS filter & editable ID |
